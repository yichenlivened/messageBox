# messageBox

The messages dropdown must open when someone clicks on the small message icon (the one with the green dot). Clicking outside of the dropdown should automatically close it. Here is what it looks like when it is closed.

The messages list will come from a server-side JSON API which would be called when the users opens the dropdown. For this task, simply use your own static version. A maximum of 5 messages can be shown.

If there are no new messages, add copy to say "no new messages". Also do not show "show all messages"if there are no messages to display.

You can use regular vanilla JS, JQuery, and/or React.js. No other frameworks please.

"New message" and "show all messages" must both be links.
